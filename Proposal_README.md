### Genetics of Stromal Keratitis
1. At least 80 percent of the adult human population may be sero-positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV). When the eye becomes the site of infection, a chronic immuno-inflammatory syndrome may result thus impairing vision. Such herpetic stromal keratitis (SK) lesions represent the commonest infectious cause of blindness in the western world. 

2. I am interested in knowing how genes are expressed during infection of the HSV virus in the eyes of male and female mice using RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. In particular, I intend to compare gene expression in HSV-infected mice to wild type non-infected mice. The WGS will help to discover any mutation and/or common variants associated with HSV-induced stromal keratitis. RNA-seq data will be used in detecting potential changes in gene expression, alternative splicing, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusions as well as mutations and SNPs. 

3. I hypothesize that there will be differential gene expression between the infected and non-infected mice, and between male and female mice. The goal of the project is to identify the types of genomic responses and defenses that mice (and potentially, human beings) use to prevent or adapt to HSV infection. To foster knowledge sharing, I am open to collaborating with coursemates to develop a project that incorporates if not all, some of our interests. 

4. Raw DNA sequence from paired-end next-generation sequencing (NGS) will be assessed for quality and the reference genome of Mus musculus (mice) will be indexed. Good quality sequence will be aligned to the reference genome. We will then do post-processing and identify variants for further evolutionary and medical analysis.
